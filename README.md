## Description
This is an Ionic Angular movie reviewing application (web browser demo) where you can see trending movies with an infinite scroll feature, 
and their names, posters, scores, genres, taglines, overviews, and the year the movies were published in.

## Purpose
Uni assignment demo, on learning more about Ionic's components and frameworks.

## Status
